# Code for "Improving Drone-captured Maritime Rescue Image Object Detection with Dataset Re-balancing under Sample Constraints" (Under Peer Review)

## Overview

This repository contains the code supporting the result in the paper *"Improving Drone-captured Maritime Rescue Image Object Detection with Dataset Re-balancing under Sample Constraints"*, which is currently under peer review. The study addresses the issue of sample imbalance and scarcity in the SeaDronesSee dataset, and proposes a greedy algorithm-based method for re-partitioning the dataset to improve model training and generalization.

## SeaDronesSee Dataset

The SeaDronesSee dataset is available on the official GitHub repository: [SeaDronesSee GitHub](https://github.com/Ben93kie/SeaDronesSee).  
The `instances_train.json` and `instances_val.json` files used in this code can be found in the official SeaDronesSee dataset, which is downloadable from the following link: [Download SeaDronesSee Dataset](https://cloud.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/index.php/s/aJQPHLGnke68M52).
